We invite submissions addressing, but not limited to, the following areas impacting development of agentic AI with a particular focus on developers:

- **Interfaces for building agentic AI:** tools, dashboards, low/no-code builders, multimodal debugging aids.
- **Transparency, observability, and debugging:** methods for revealing agent state, reasoning, and decision-making; UI design patterns for trust and control.
- **User oversight, trust, and control:** frameworks for mixed-initiative planning, confirmation prompts, pause/undo, signaling agent confidence or uncertainty.
- **Evaluation and real-world usefulness:** methodologies for user-centered evaluation, case studies of deployment, metrics for trustworthiness, safety, and agentic ROI.

We particularly welcome case studies, interactive demos, and evaluation frameworks that highlight real-world impact.
