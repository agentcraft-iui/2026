# Call for Papers
**AgentCraft: Workshop on Agentic AI Systems Development**  
*Held in conjunction with the 31st ACM International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI 2026)*  
**March 23–26, 2026 — Paphos, Cyprus**

## Workshop Overview {#workshop-overview}
Ambitious efforts are underway to build AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) across domains including programming, productivity, creative work, and enterprise automation. Despite recent progress, major challenges remain in ensuring agent autonomy, interpretability, oversight, and real-world reliability. Developers struggle to understand and debug agent behavior, to decide when human input is needed, and to evaluate usefulness beyond narrow benchmarks.

The AgentCraft workshop will bring together researchers, developers, and designers to address these challenges. Our focus is on equipping developers with the tools, methods, and evaluation frameworks needed to design, test, and deploy agentic systems responsibly.

## Topics of Interest {#topics-of-interest}
We invite submissions addressing, but not limited to, the following areas impacting development of agentic AI with a particular focus on developers:

- **Interfaces for building agentic AI:** tools, dashboards, low/no-code builders, multimodal debugging aids.
- **Transparency, observability, and debugging:** methods for revealing agent state, reasoning, and decision-making; UI design patterns for trust and control.
- **User oversight, trust, and control:** frameworks for mixed-initiative planning, confirmation prompts, pause/undo, signaling agent confidence or uncertainty.
- **Evaluation and real-world usefulness:** methodologies for user-centered evaluation, case studies of deployment, metrics for trustworthiness, safety, and agentic ROI.

We particularly welcome case studies, interactive demos, and evaluation frameworks that highlight real-world impact.

## Submission Details {#submission-details}
We welcome **research or demo papers** (minimum **5 pages**, maximum **10 pages**).  
Submissions should strictly be formatted according to the **CEUR** template. All papers will undergo a **single-blind** peer review (i.e., author names and affiliations should be listed). LaTeX users should use `\conference{Joint Proceedings of the ACM IUI Workshops 2026, March 23-26, 2026, Paphos, Cyprus}`. Accepted papers will be included in the CEUR proceedings. At least one author must register for the workshop and present their work.

### Important Dates {#important-dates}

- **Notification to authors:** February 2, 2026  
- **Camera-ready CEUR papers to workshop chairs:** February 16, 2026  
- **Anticipated workshop date:** March 23, 2026

## Workshop Format {#workshop-format}
The workshop will be a full-day mini-conference including:
- Keynote presentation(s)
- Paper presentations
- Interactive demo & poster sessions
- Breakout discussions and report-back sessions

We aim to identify best practices, propose new evaluation frameworks, and foster collaborations between academia and industry.
