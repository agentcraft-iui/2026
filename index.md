## Overview {#workshop-overview}

Ambitious efforts are underway to build AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) across domains including programming, productivity, creative work, and enterprise automation. Despite recent progress, major challenges remain in ensuring agent autonomy, interpretability, oversight, and real-world reliability. Developers struggle to understand and debug agent behavior, to decide when human input is needed, and to evaluate usefulness beyond narrow benchmarks.

The AgentCraft workshop will bring together researchers, developers, and designers to address these challenges. Our focus is on equipping developers with the tools, methods, and evaluation frameworks needed to design, test, and deploy agentic systems responsibly.

## Workshop Goals & Format {#workshop-goals}

Our primary goal is to **identify a set of guidelines and best practices** for developing and debugging LLM-based agentic AI systems. Central to this challenge is understanding how to develop and evaluate agentic AI systems in a human-centered way that includes actual users rather than solely evaluating agent performance on artifical benchmarks that purport to simulate real-world tasks.

The workshop will be a full-day mini-conference including:

- Keynote presentation(s)
- Paper presentations
- Interactive demo & poster sessions
- Breakout discussions and report-back sessions

We aim to build a community of researchers, developers, and designers spanning academic and industry research to encourage new ideas and new collaborations to develop.

## Submissions {#submission-details}
